        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>his recipe recreates the light, open-crumbed focaccia we ate in Bari, Italy. To achieve 
            that texture, the dough must be wetâ€”so wet, in fact, it verges on a thick, yet pourable 
            batter. Resist the temptation to add more flour than is called for. Shaping such a 
            sticky, high-hydration dough by hand is impossible. Instead, the dough is gently 
            poured and scraped into the oiled baking pan; gravity settles it into an even layer. 
            If you have trouble finding Castelvetrano olives, substitute any large, meaty green 
            olive.</p>
            <p> 
            To slice the baked focaccia for serving, use a serrated knife and a sawing 
            motion to cut through the crust and crumb without compressing it. If desired, 
            serve with extra-virgin olive oil for dipping. For convenience, the dough can be 
            prepared and transferred to the baking pan a day in advance. After it has settled in the 
            pan, cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate. The next day, prepare the toppings. 
            Uncover, top the dough with the olives and tomatoes and let stand at room temperature for 
            45 minutes, then finish and bake as directed.</p>
